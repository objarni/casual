Casual - examples of mundane programming tasks in X languages
=============================================================


Why?
----
I sit with many different languages every day, and small syntactic
differences annoy me to have to google all the time. IntelliSense
does not help with how to write an object literal, or a for-loop!


How?
----
X number of self-verifying input files in different languages
display the syntax of needed 'language features' clearly and within
one page of code (no more!).

Any and all of the examples should:

1. Object literal --> A
2. Parse inputJSON --> B
3. Produce a text string from A and B --> Atxt, Btxt
4. Verify Atxt == Btxt
5. Produce a text report from A --> Areport
6. Verify Areport equals report_str


What?
-----
* Looping over lists
* Writing object literals, including lists, string properties
* Reading JSON string
* Asserting
* Interpolating and concatenating string
